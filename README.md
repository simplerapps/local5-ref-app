As a user, you can install the app and add any service icons you like for local businesses, organizations, museums, etc. to get their communications and discounts.

As an enterprise, you can use the "Participation Group" feature to utilize the same app for private conversations.

### Communication Tool Out Of The Box

New service icons can be added by your organization utilizing the same app. Once a service is added, it can utilize existing components such as the communication component to post messages.
To communicate, you can post messages with photos and all people following your service will get notified real-time and can comment on your message.
You can also format your messages with fonts and link to external web pages and resources.

### For an enterprise, the screenshot below shows the "Participation Group" feature.

When you create an account and add yourself to the group (after knowing the password), you can create your own exclusive services with private communications.
Teams in an organization can use this feature to publish real-time information about their current projects to help with cross-functional team collaboration and communication.
