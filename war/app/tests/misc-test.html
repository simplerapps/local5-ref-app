		<h2>TEST HEADING ONE 11</h2>

		Pop icon Prince -- one of the most influential but elusive figures in music -- died suddenly at his compound in Minnesota on Thursday, a representative said. He was 57.
		"It is with profound sadness that I am confirming that the legendary, iconic performer, Prince Rogers Nelson, has died at his Paisley Park residence this morning," said his spokeswoman, Yvette Noel-Schure.
		She did not offer further details. Local authorities outside Minneapolis said that they were investigating a death at Paisley Park, with local media showing images of emergency vehicles.
		The pop legend last week was taken to a hospital after his private jet made an unscheduled landing.
		But Prince was said to be suffering the flu and made light of the situation, later posting on Twitter about a local shop in Minneapolis for Record Store Day.
